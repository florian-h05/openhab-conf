# openHAB configuration [@florian-h05](https://github.com/florian-h05)

### Parts of my openHAB 3 configuration.

Sharing my configuration for others to get an idea about production openHAB installations.

# WARNING #

### If you want to do this with your own openHAB configuration, please be _VERY CAREFUL_ to prevent sharing your personal/secret information, such as:

#### Wifi credentials (SSID/password)
#### Account Password (iCloud, ...)
#### API keys (Nest, ...)
#### Location (Astro, weather forecast, ...)

Use GITIGNORE files to properly hide those files from your GitHub repo. 

Be AWARE that even if you delete the file from your repo after accidentally uploading it, the information is STILL THERE (GitHub keeps revision history). The ONLY way to get rid of the information is to DELETE the repo and start over!!!
